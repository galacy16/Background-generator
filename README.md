# Background-generator
A simple background generator using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

The user can create a two color linear gradient background, and the user can set two directions: right to left or left to right. 
The default setting is linear-gradient (to right, rgb(0, 255, 0), rgb(255, 0, 0)).
